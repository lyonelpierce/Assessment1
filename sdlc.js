const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysis =
  "In this stage the software requirements are gathered and analyzed to ensure that the software meets the end-user needs.";

const design =
  "The architecture is designed based on the requirements. Ensure that the design is scalable, maintainable and efficient.";

const implementation =
  "In this stage, the software code is developed based on the design specifications. The development team is in charge of writing the code.";

const testing =
  "The developed software is tested to ensure that meet the requirements and work as expected to meet the end-user needs.";

const maintenance =
  "This will occur after the product has been released into the production environment. Regular maintenance is performed, bugs are fixed, and updates are implemented as required.";
